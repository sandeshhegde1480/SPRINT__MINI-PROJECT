# SPRINT__MINI-PROJECT

Project overview:
The project is 'AI-based PDF Filler Project'. In this project, the main aim was to analyse the pdf contents, and the questions asked in the pdf, generate the answer based on the data given, and place the answers in a pdf template as in the given. The project uses various python powerfull modules to extract the text, processing, answer generation and placement.

Installation:
The project is done on 'Google Colab'. The Google colab provides many of the inbuilt python modules for the developing the projects. Hence the project can be opened through the the drive link given in the repository which directs to the 'project.ipynb'

Execution:
The first code cell is for mounting google drive.
The second code cel is for installing the python modules.
The third code cell is for importing the required modules functionalities.
The fourth code cell is for the database (as the project is limited the certain template and tested with the only one file, the data is taken as string ).
The fifth code cell is for the functions.
The sixth code cell is for the main program.
The seventh code cell is for the variable storing the input datapath.
Run all the 7 code blocks (7th is optional).
On running the 6th code cell, it asks for the input path. Then provide the path mentioned in the seventh cell or the path where the input pdf is stored. Once the path is given, The appropriate messages appear as the output the filenme will be displayed. 

Recommended: Download the 'Dummy_Questionnaire.pdf' from the given drive folder to your system and upload the same file to the temporary drive storage once you mount the drive as an execution part (run code cell 1 ). Then copy the file path and input the path as an input path to the main program.
